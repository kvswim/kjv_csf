1. See figure 1.1, 1.2. 
	R S | Q !Q
	0 0 | Both	Illegal for NAND
	0 1 | 1 0	0 1 for NAND
	1 0 | 0 1 	1 0 for NAND
	1 1 | Illegal	Both/Mem for NAND

	NAND uses the same number of gates. NAND works on the
	rising edge clock, NOR works on the falling edge. 
	There is no change in the propagation time, only a frameshift
	from the change edge->falling.

2. See figure 2. Uses D type FF and 2:1 muxers. 

3. See figure 3. We can use 2 parallel multiplexers, one 2-input before NOT for
	NOT selection, and one after all logic manipulations for user selection
	of AND/OR/NOT/ADD. 

4. To convert an RS latch to edge triggered, stick another RS latch in front of it.
	In this way we prove there are double the amount of D type latches for edge
	triggering than there are for a standard level trigger design. 
	8 bits in a byte, 1 million bytes (8m bits) in a Mb. 
	We know each RS latch holds 1 bit of data. For 1 Mb we need 8m flipflops
	and with 2 RS latches each we will need 16m RS latches. 
	Since we are working with a binomial distribution, we know the PMF is
	P(X)=nCr(n,k)*p^k*(1-p)^(n-k). Since we are working with total sample data
	this can simplify to P(x)=p^n, that is probability of success = reliability^
	sample number.
	So success of 1Mb=.99^16000000 = 0.85, or 85.2% of success.
	Then with 4GB, we would need 4b bytes= 32b bits= 32b ff's = 64b latches.
	Working backwards, 0.99=x^(64000000000)
	x~=1. For 99% chance of success, manufacturing would need basically 100% reliability.
