# scram.py - Really simple virtual machine for binary .scram files.
#
# Hacked by Peter H. Froehlich <phf@acm.org> for
# 600.333/433: Computer Systems Fundamentals, Fall 2012.
# Ported to Python 3, Summer 2016.
#
# Usage: ./scram.py <input.scram [max]
#
# Reads a *binary* file representing all of the SCRAM's memory from
# standard input. This file can be at *most* 16 bytes long since we
# only have 16 bytes of memory available.
#
# The SCRAM starts running code at address 0. After each and every
# instruction, all of main memory as well as AC and PC is dumped to
# standard output.
#
# The SCRAM stops when encountering either the HLT instruction or
# some kind of illegal instruction. If a number is given on the
# command line, the SCRAM stops after that many instructions.
